# Simplification of Vector Field Topology - MATLAB Code
### Keshav Chandak(IMT2021003)
### Akash Perla(IMT2021530) 

This folder contains MATLAB codes for the simplification of vector field topology. The codes named `Original_Topo_Main.m` and `Simplified_Topo_Main.m` are needed to be executed for visualisation. The test vector field functions are stored in `test_vector_field.m`.

## Installation

Before you can run the code, you need to have MATLAB installed on your machine. If you do not have MATLAB, you can download and install it from the official website: [https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).

## Usage

To run the code, follow the steps below:

1. Download the codes as a ZIP file and extract it to the local machine.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder where you extracted the code.
3. Open `Original_Topo_Main.m` or `Simplified_Topo_Main.m` in MATLAB depending on which code you want to run.
4. Run `Original_Topo_Main.m` or `Simplified_Topo_Main.m` in MATLAB by using the `Run` button on the navigation bar.
5. After the code is run, the command window asks for the following:-
   ```matlab
   Choose a test field by selecting number between 1 and 4:(enter appropriate value)
6. Wait for some time to see the graph generated.
7. To see the difference between the original topology and the simplified topology, it is advisable to enter the same number as choice of test vector field when running these codes, so that the difference between them is visible.

The codes will generate output files in the same folder as the code. The output files will contain the topology graph of the vector field for the chosen test case. The graph generated by `Original_Topo_Main.m` will be saved as `Original_Topology.png`, and the graph generated by `Simplified_Topo_Main.m` will be saved as `Simplified_Topology.png`.

## Example Usage

Suppose you want to run `Original_Topo_Main.m` for the second test case. Follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository or download the code as a ZIP file and extract it to your local machine.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder where you extracted the code.
3. Open `Original_Topo_Main.m` in MATLAB and run it.
4. After the code is run, the command window asks for the following:-
   ```matlab
   Choose a test field by selecting number between 1 and 4:2
5. The graph generation takes some time and then after the whole execution of the code, a graph is generated which is the original topology of test field 2 and it is stored in the local system in the same directory as well named `Original_Topology.png`
